<p id="pd">I wrote to Steve after his liver transplant wishing him well.
 I had a liver transplant two years before him, I knew what he was going through. He was larger than life. 
Thanks for making this world a better and more fun place. </p>

<h3 style="max-width: 600px;">Memories</h3>
<p id="pd">Steve Jobs created the company that made every computer I ever owned, helped found the studio that made some of my favorite films and widely legitimized my field, donated hardware to every one of my public schools, and, indirectly, provided my mom with work for almost two decades. He was an awesome man, and he'll be greatly missed.

<h3 style="max-width: 600px;">Legacy</h3>
<p id="pd">My thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends.
     What a great man we have lost. The legacy he leaves behind is amazing.
      Such a great mind and spirit to be taken so young.
     Peace and blessings to all during this very difficult time.</p>

<h3 style="max-width: 750px;">A Legacy Like No Other</h3>
<p id="pd">I have had a Mac since my first 128Kb model in 1984.
 In all I have done since that date I have used and promoted Apple.
 Steve Jobs created a legacy of millions of devoted advocates who prided themselves in being different because it made them better. Creative professionals and imaginative individuals worldwide will keep the spirit
 of Steve Jobs alive through their loyalty to his vision and attitude otherwise
  known as Apple. </p>

     <h3 style="max-width: 900px;">one hell of a life, Steve. we're forever grateful.</h3>
<p id="pd">Dear Steve, and your brainchild Apple, My message is gonna be simple and sweet, just like all of your inventions. I can still remembered the day when I navigated the internet for the first time from a screen with a rainbow-colored apple stamped on it. 1997 was the year when this ten-year-old girl saw the whole world opened up to her, all while sitting on the attic of her house in Jakarta, Indonesia. The experience was, of course, highly personal. And I think that is what your biggest invention is, Steve. You personalized your invention in a way no one could ever match - aint nothing like my love for my first Macbook.
 One hell of a life, Steve. And I'm forever grateful. </p>
